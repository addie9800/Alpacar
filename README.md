# alpacar
This is a school project which in which we try to lessen the traffic into the alps. During the last two years, we have spent time researching about ecological consequences due to traffic. We have learned that individual traffic is a big influence on the climate of the alps. Our goal is to write an app which allows people to communicate and go on holiday together, so that less cars need to used which would result in less polution.
Thanks for your interest in our project
